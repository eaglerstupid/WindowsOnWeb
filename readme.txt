This is a build for web/javascript using Emscripten.  It also contains a simple web page as an example for launching games.

This contains a super stripped down version of the Wine 6.0 file system, boxedwine.zip.

This stripped down file system should handle a lot of 32-bit/16-bit apps and games and includes DirectDraw support.  OpenGL and Direct3D are not supported.
